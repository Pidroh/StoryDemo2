START:
I stare at Red Merlin's face.

Red Merlin: Don't do it, please.

Red Merlin: We can make this work, I can be useful to you.

When it comes to it, they all beg. My eyes find his weapon.

Death 34: A fine rod you have there.

Silence. Just let it go, Merlin.

Red Merlin: Fine, you win.

The item received message comes up.

Good boy. Red Merlin runs past me, likely heading back to town.

Death 34: Have any last words?

Red Merlin stops, silent for a few seconds.

Red Merlin: C'mon, I gave you my weapon! Five stars, damn it!

Red Merlin: What else do you want? I can do it.

My mouth lets out a smile. My breath becomes louder in anticipation.

Red Merlin: I'll do whatever you want. Really, I promise.

We connect for one last time. Me and Merlin. My blade and his digital flesh.
117 kills.

Dad: Dinner is ready, Sara!

Finally. If I can just go back to town and log out...
#pb

Somebody knocks at the door.

Dad: You'll be deaf when you get to my age.

Sara: Dinner, right? I'm coming, I'm coming.

I take off my headphones and put the RXPlay back in the charger.

Dad: If you heard it, you could at least reply...

Dad is annoying, but in a cute way. Always the victim. Most parents would get pretty angry at a daughter like me.
Chicken, salad, rice. It looks pretty yummy.

Sara: Mom is late again, huh?

Dad: Yes, stuck at the office.. It's a big project, she says.

Yeah, right. A big project. Sure.

Sara: What kind of guy do you think he is?

Dad: Who?

Sara: Mom's lover.

Dad gets all surprised, but his face turns to bitterness.

Dad: That joke is getting old, Sara.

I smile at my old man. An honest smile with just a dash of pity.
I turn to my food as a tomato catches my eye.
I wonder if Red Merlin is crying now. Level 56, Pyromage, high level equipment. He probably invested over a hundred hours into the game. 
All gone now. I would cry. Maybe.

Dad: What's wrong? Does it taste bad?

Guess I got caught staring at the tomato.

Sara: Nah, it tastes great.

I can feel dad looking at me as I eat up. It really does taste good though.

Dad: So what have you been up to, lately? Still playing that permadeath game?

Sara: Yeah.

Dad: Brian died last week, did I tell you?

Brian. So dad still keeps contact with him. Cool that their friendship survived retirement.

Sara: No, I didn't know he played.

Dad: Well, retirement opens up a hole in our lives. 

Dad: Some buy tons of novels and read only half...

Dad's expression sours.

Dad: Some play MMORPGs, like Brian.

Sara: What level was him?

Dad: 40 something. Another player got to him.

Oops. That may have been me. Sorry, Brian.

Sara: It's a tough game, you have to be really careful. 

Dad: So I've heard. He's looking for a new game now. One where you can try again if you die.

Sara: What's the fun in that?

Dad lets out a short laugh. He quietly stares off into the window. I hope things work out between him and mom. We wash the dishes together and I go back to my room. There should still be time for another hunt.
